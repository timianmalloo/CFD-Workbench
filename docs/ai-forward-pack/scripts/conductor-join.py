"""conductor-join.py - the join, as a script: every step gated by its exit code, none by a
shell line.

The control for defect class DC-113's fourth recurrence (measured 2026-09-13, a consuming
repo's join): the conductor resolved a register conflict, piped the conflict-marker gate
through `| tail -1`, read the gate's remedy text as a pass, and committed a merge carrying
`<<<<<<<` (DC-136's shape) - caught only because the gate runner was re-run bare before the
push. Three earlier recurrences had the same cause: a hand-typed line at the join whose
status was the formatter's, not the gate's. This script IS the join line. It has no pipes;
each step is a subprocess whose return code decides whether the next runs. The
`execute-with-coordination` skill names it as the only join line.

Steps, in order, stop on the first red (the exit status is the failing step's number):
  0. leader fence                     `coord-core.py leader who --json` BEFORE the merge (and
                                      before --continue): refused with exit 11 (EXIT_FENCE - 0
                                      is success) when the epoch this join carries (--epoch,
                                      default: the ref's epoch at the join's start) is lower
                                      than the ref's, or when the ref cannot be read; an absent
                                      ref is "not applicable" (S2 has no leader)
 0b. dirty-primary fence              refuses dirt outside .agents/log/ before merging or
                                      resuming with --continue (exit 12); changes stay in place
  1. git merge --no-ff <branch>       a conflict stops here with the file list; resolve by hand,
                                      `git add`, `git commit --no-edit`, re-run with --continue
  2. audit marker                     `audit-log.py start --session <s> --skill execute-with-coordination`
                                      so the join's own duration is MEASURED (a resumed or
                                      hand-typed join set none: 14 of 14 join entries carried
                                      no duration, no tier, no fan-out)
  3. verify-no-conflict-markers       ALWAYS, before anything else reads the tree
  4. checks, then the recount         from join.json (`checks`, `recount`); the recount is timed
                                      as recount_seconds - the largest cost centre of a measured
                                      programme (44.8% of the conductor's active main line) and
                                      the one no entry recorded. --docs-only skips the recount.
  5. audit-log append                 tier T1, fan-out 0, the marker's duration, recount_seconds
  6. regenerate                       `regenerate` from join.json, default `coord-core.py regen`
  7. stage own outputs; commit         merge result, changed derived views, audit entry, session logs;
                                      refuse residual dirt before gates or push (exit 7)
  8. gates                            `gates` from join.json, default `run-verify-gates.py`
  9. git push <remote> <branch>       only if 8 passed; --no-push skips
 10. build                            `build` from join.json, optional; --no-build skips

join.json (default docs/coordination/join.json; --join <path> overrides; absent = defaults):
  { "checks":     [["python3", "tools/verify-register.py", "--fix-counts"]],
    "recount":    [["python3", "tools/verify-test-run.py", "--update"]],

    "push_remote": "origin",
    "trailer_file": "docs/coordination/commit-trailer.txt" }
  A command whose first word is `python3` or `python` runs under THIS interpreter.

Usage (from the checkout the join lands on):
  python3 conductor-join.py <branch> --title "<merge title>" --audit-shortname <name>
      --audit-summary "<text>" --audit-goal "<text>" --audit-done-when "<text>"
      [--artifact <path> ...] [--docs-only] [--no-push] [--no-build] [--continue]
      [--join <join.json>] [--session <id>] [--self-test]

Exit 0 on a complete join; the failing step's number otherwise; 11 when the leader fence (step
0) refuses; 12 for dirty-primary refusal (also --continue); 13 for a merge refusal without
unmerged paths (a real conflict remains 1); 7 for residual dirt after committing; 2 on a usage
error. Stdlib only.
